The HSC-like Bulge+Disk+Knot (BDK) simulation is an HSC version of the BDK
simulation \citep{metacal-Sheldon2017}. The simulation is generated by Galsim which is an
open-source image simulation package \citep{GalSim}. We use Sersic models
\citep{Sersic1963} which are fitted to the $25.2$ magnitude limited galaxy
sample from the COSMOS data
\footnote{\url{great3.jb.man.ac.uk/leaderboard/data/public/COSMOS_25.2_training_sample.tar.gz}}
to simulate the bulge and disk of galaxies. The fluxes of these galaxies are
scaled by a factor of $2.587$ to match the fluxes in HSC observation. In order
to avoid repeating the exact parameters, we interpolate the joint radius-flux
distribution by randomly rescaling the radius and flux of the original Sersic
model. To simulate the knots of star formation, we distribute $N$ random points
which statistically obey the Gaussian distribution around the center of the
galaxies, where $N$ is a random number evenly distributed between $50$ and
$100$. The ellipticity of the Gaussian distribution follows the ellipticity of
Sersic model and the half light radius of the Gaussian distribution is fixed to
$2.4$ pixels. The pixel scale of the simulation is set to the HSC pixel scale,
namely $0.168''$. The fraction of the flux of the knots is a random number
evenly distributed between $0\%$ and $10\%$. The galaxies are rotated to random
directions and subsequently sheared by the same shear signal
($g_1=0.02,g2=0.00$). For the HSC-like BDK simulation, we use $g_1$ to
determine the multiplicative bias and use $g_2$ to determine the additive bias.
The galaxy images are convolved with a galaxy model of the first-year HSC
data release.

% The galaxy images are convolved with a Moffat PSF \citep{Moffat1969}
% \begin{equation}\label{Moffat PSF}
% g_{m}(\vec{x})=[1+c(|\vec{x}|/r_p)^2]^{-\beta_m},  \end{equation} where
% $c=2^{\frac{1}{\beta_m-1}}-1$ is a constant parameter. The profile of the
% Moffat PSF is determined by $\beta_m$, where $\beta_{m}=3.5$. The scale of the
% Moffat PSF is determined by its Full Width Half Maximum (FWHM), where
% $\rm{FWHM}=0.6$.  The ellipticity of the Moffat PSF is set to
% $(e_1=0,e_2=0.025)$.

Each convolved galaxy is placed around the center of a $64\times 64$ stamp. The
HSC-like BDK simulation generate $4\times 10^8$ galaxies.
