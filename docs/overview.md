This paper derives the correction for **detection bias**. Scripts used to produce
plots in the paper can be found [here](../notebooks/paper_2022).

+ [version 2.0](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021arXiv211001214L/abstract):
This paper derives the covariance matrix of FPFS measurements and corrects for
**noise bias** to second-order. In addition, it derives the correction for galaxy
sample **selection bias**. Scripts used to produce plots in the paper can be found
[here](../notebooks/paper_2021).

+ [version 1.0](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018MNRAS.481.4445L/abstract):
This paper builds up the FPFS formalism based on
[Fourier_Quad](https://arxiv.org/abs/1312.5514) and
[Shapelets](https://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0408445).
