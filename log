#BUG:   find a bug. gal2 is mistaken to gal1 in cgcSim. Need to redo simulations
#       Be careful when copy and paste
#Plan:  must add peak (input source position) to sources since undetection rate is too large.
#       Maybe we need to discuss with Ryoma and Surhud about undetected sources..

#Plan:  We focus on the case that distances between two galaxies are larger than 2 arcsec. Since for this case,
#       the blending cannot be detected efficiently...
#       For the case the distances between two galaxies are below 2 arcsec, we need to use COSMOS HST 
#       data to constrain what is the density of such galaxy pairs. 
#       I think they turn out to be the undetected blending bias if the galaxies in one pair are from different redshifts.

#BUG1:  too much tasks for one processor (mpi4py)?
#       change to only 1 task on processor from (old) 32 tasks per processor
#BUG2:  nrot for faint galaxies should be more 
#BUG3:  peak outside of footprint. Need to reset the Spans in the future.
#(Have not done)
