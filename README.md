# FPFS2


# Goal
----
1.Develop second generation of FPFS shear estimator to reduce the noise bias below 0.1%
2.Test whether  conclusion of https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.02505
(The influence of neighbouring object is small and deblending is not needed if the detection bias is corrected) applies to FPFS2.
