# uniCalib_Private
go beyond sample dependent shear calibration for blending bias ??

# plan
sim: make different galaxy image simulations
    rgc: COSMOS image
    cgc: Sersic model galaxy image
        oneShear: two blended galaxies have the same shear (same redshift plan)
        twoShear: two blended galaxies have the different shear (different redshift plan)
ana: 
    use machine learning to study the galaxy bias (multiplicative bias and fractional additive bias)


# Goal
Prove that we can apply the calibration to gr(i)zy band image of HSC survey??
